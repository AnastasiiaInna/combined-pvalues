Examples
========

Each of the sub-directories in the examples/ directory contains
a README giving an overview of the analysis, and a `run.sh` which
describes the set of commands used to run the analysis.


CHARM
-----

An example on Comprehensive Arrays for Relative Methylation, using
a linear model with data from

```
    Irizarry, R.A. et al. (2009). The human colon cancer methylome
    shows similar hypo- and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-speciÔ¨Åc
    CpG island shores. Nature Genetics, 41, 178-186.
```

BS-Seq
------

An example comparing bisulfite sequencing data between *Arabidopsis thaliana*
embryo and endosperm tissues using p-values from Fisher's exact test.
The data is from:
