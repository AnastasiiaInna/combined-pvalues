The original Kechris et al. 2010 paper finds enrichment regions from
from data generated by the DamID technology followed by tiling arrays.
Here, we attempt to recreate their results.

Their p-values ::

    wget http://amc-sandbox.ucdenver.edu/~brentp/2012/comb-p/data/probes.sorted.bed


We run `comb-p` on the p-values with a seed of 0.1, indicating that we'll
require an slk and FDR corrected p-value of 0.1 or less to start a region.
A maximum distance (--dist) of 1600 indicates that it will look 1600 bases
for another p-value of 0.1 or less to extend the region.

of 1600. ::

    comb-p pipeline \
        --seed 0.1 \
        -p cnew \
        -c 4 \
        --dist 1600 \
        probes.sorted.bed

We then compare the regions from Kechris' paper to compare to the ones founds
with `comb-p`

::

    wget http://amc-sandbox.ucdenver.edu/~brentp/2012/comb-p/data/kechris.regions.be

We count the number of regions per file::

    $ grep -cv "#" cnew.regions-p.bed 
    1248 cnew.regions-p.bed
         
    $ wc -l kechris.regions.bed 
    878 kechris.regions.bed

And the intersections::

    $ intersectBed -b cnew.regions-p.bed -a kechris.regions.bed -u | wc -l
    695

So 695 of Kechris' 878 regions (79%) are represented in the `comb-p` regions.
However, we can see that the regions of overlap have a much higher
enrichment score, again indicating that the regions that overlap are higher
quality::

    $ intersectBed -b cnew.regions-p.bed -a kechris.regions.bed -u \
        | awk '{ sum+=$4 }END{ print sum/NR}'
    2.25478

Than those that do not overlap::

    $ intersectBed -b cnew.regions-p.bed -a kechris.regions.bed -v \
        | awk '{ sum+=$4 }END{ print sum/NR}'
    1.21027

In addition, the ttest on those numbers has a 2-sided p-value of
2.98e-59, indicating that the overlapping set is much different
than the set that does not overlap.

We can also filter the `comb-p` regions by p-value and check the overlap.
83 regions have a corrected p-values less than 0.01::

   $ awk '$7 < 0.01' cnew.regions-p.bed | wc -l
   83

All of those intersect with Kechris regions::

    $ awk '$7 < 0.01' cnew.regions-p.bed \ 
            | intersectBed -a - -b kechris.regions.bed -u | wc -l
    83

This is true all the way up to a p-value of less than 1. ::

    $ awk '$7 < 1' cnew.regions-p.bed | wc -l
    413

    $ awk '$7 < 1' cnew.regions-p.bed \
        | intersectBed -a - -b kechris.regions.bed -u | wc -l
    409

So 409 of 413 of the regions with a corrected p-value less than 1
occur in Kechris' regions. This indicates that the p-value is a good
indicator of confidence.
